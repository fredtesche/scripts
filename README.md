# scripts

**BA$H rules everything around me**  
*installbolt.sh* is a BASH script that automates the installation of Bolt CMS on CentOS 7.  
*vyosvm.sh* is a BASH script that will pretty quickly spin up a vyOS VM in VirtualBox.  
*office365_ipv4.py* is a Python script that will grab Micro$oft Office 365 IPs from their site and format them into something that a Cisco router prefers.
